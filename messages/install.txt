Thanks for installing StataEditor for Sublime Text 3!

To use this package, you need to install the Pywin32 package which is available from Package Control.

You also need to provide the path to your Stata installation. To do so, go to Preferences -> Settings - More -> Syntax Specific - User. Paste {"stata_path": "C:/Program Files (x86)/Stata13/StataMP-64.exe"} in the file, change the directory to the path of your Stata installation (note that you need to use forward slash, "/", instead of backward slash, "\") and save the file. 

You also need to register the Stata Automation type library. Instructions can be found  at http://www.stata.com/automation/#createmsapp. You may have to use the instructions for Windows Vista even if you do not use Vista as your operating system. 

For additional information on setup and features, see the Readme file.
